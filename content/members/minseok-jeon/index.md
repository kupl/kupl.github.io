# About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Korea University](https://korea.ac.kr). I received my Ph.D. from [Software Analysis Laboratory](https://prl.korea.ac.kr) at [Korea University](https://korea.ac.kr) under the supervision of [Prof. Hakjoo Oh]({{< ref "/members/hakjoo-oh" >}}). I enjoy developing domain-specific languages (DSLs) (along with DSL program synthesis algorithms) to address various challenges in programming languages and software engineering. I have developed DSLs for developing effective pointer analysis and software testing.


# Research Interests
I am interested in designing domain-specific programming languages (DSLs) and developing program synthesis algorithms to address problems in programming languages and software engineering. More specifically, my research aims to design domain-specific programming languages (DSLs) that can describe solutions for given programming problems in languages or software engineering, and develop program synthesis algorithms to automatically find these solutions in the DSLs.

- **Designing domain-specific languages (DSLs)** tailored to tackle challenges in programming languages and software engineering.
- **Developing program synthesis algorithms** for automatically generating programs (solutions) in DSLs.

In particular, my focus is on designing DSLs and synthesis algorithms for effective pointer analysis, a key component in compiler optimization. Additionally, I am interested in developing DSLs tailored to identify effective test cases in system software testing.
